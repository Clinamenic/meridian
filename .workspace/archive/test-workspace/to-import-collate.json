      "description": "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) use smart contracts to foster communities working toward common goals. Existing definitions of decentralization, however-the 'D' in DAO-fall short of capturing key properties characteristic of diverse and equitable participation. We propose a new metric called Voting-Bloc Entropy (VBE, pronounced ''vibe'') that formalizes a broad notion of decentralization in voting on DAO proposals. VBE measures the similarity of participants' utility functions across a set of proposals. We use VBE to prove a number of results about the decentralizing effects of vote delegation, proposal bundling, bribery, and quadratic voting. Our results lead to practical suggestions for enhancing DAO decentralization. One of our results highlights the risk of systemic bribery with increasing DAO decentralization. To show that this threat is realistic, we present the first practical realization of a Dark DAO, a proposed mechanism for privacy-preserving corruption of identity systems, including those used in DAO voting. Our Dark-DAO prototype uses trusted execution environments (TEEs) in the Oasis Sapphire blockchain for attacks on Ethereum DAOs. It demonstrates that Dark DAOs constitute a realistic future concern for DAO governance.",

      "description": "Democratic governments comprise a subset of a population whose goal is to produce coherent decisions, solving societal challenges while respecting the will of the people. New governance frameworks represent this as a social network rather than as a hierarchical pyramid with centralized authority. But how should this network be structured? We model the decisions a population must make as a satisfiability problem and the structure of information flow involved in decision-making as a social hypergraph. This framework allows to consider different governance structures, from dictatorships to direct democracy. Between these extremes, we find a regime of effective governance where small overlapping decision groups make specific decisions and share information. Effective governance allows even incoherent or polarized populations to make coherent decisions at low coordination costs. Beyond simulations, our conceptual framework can explore a wide range of governance strategies and their ability to tackle decision problems that challenge standard governments.",

The process has evolved significantly over the years. Until about 1900, DoD and other federal agencies enjoyed a great deal of flexibility during budget execution, sometimes ignoring congressional restrictions or using funds appropriated for one purpose to pursue another without congressional approval.",

      "description": "The early days of HCI were marked by bold visions of hypertext as a transformative medium for augmented sensemaking, exemplified in systems like Memex, Xanadu, and NoteCards. Today, however, hypertext is often disconnected from discussions of the future of sensemaking. In this paper, we investigate how the recent resurgence in hypertext “tools for thought” might point to new directions for hypertext-augmented sensemaking.",

Yet, no social infrastructure is woven into its core. Without a universal social protocol, companies have erected siloed networks, harvesting and profiting from user content—a problem intensified by centralized AI, which concentrates power and insight extraction, deepening data monopolies and eroding agency.\n\nAD4M (Agent-centric Distributed Application Meta-ontology) counters this by centering agents—primarily human users with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), though extensible to synthetic entities—and their social contexts in digital communication.",

This process is now complete. During this process, the page constantly updated in near realtime as Webb traveled, deployed, cooled to operating temperature and as instruments were turned on, tested and verified.  The most recently completed deployment/commissioning step for Webb was displayed along a timeline/schedule that indicated all the major deployment/commissiong phases. Webb's current deployment/commissioning state and regularly updated detailed status of that state were displayed along with links to relevant media. WhereIsWebb (via NASA Eyes) also provides users with a 3d model of Webb showing its location in our 3d solar system.  The James Webb Space Telescope (sometimes called Webb or JWST) is a large infrared telescope with a 6.5-meter primary mirror.  Webb will be the premier observatory of the next decade, serving thousands of astronomers worldwide. It will study every phase in the history of our Universe, ranging from the first luminous glows after the Big Bang, to the formation of solar systems capable of supporting life on planets like Earth, to the evolution of our own Solar System.",

But I’m sharing them publicly as an experiment (Work with the garage door up). If a note seems confusing or under-explained, it’s probably because I didn’t write it for you!

      "description": "Private money, public good, and the original fight for control of America’s energy industry. Until the 1930s, financial interests dominated electrical power in the United States. That changed with President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal which restructured the industry. The government expanded public ownership, famously through the Tennessee Valley Authority, and promoted a new kind of utility: the rural electric cooperative that brought light and power to millions in the countryside. Since then, public and cooperative utilities have persisted as an alternative to shareholder control. Democracy in Power traces the rise of publicly governed utilities in the twentieth-century electrification of America.  Sandeep Vaheesan shows that the path to accountability in America’s power sector was beset by bureaucratic challenges and fierce private resistance. Through a detailed and critical examination of this evolution, Vaheesan offers a blueprint for a publicly led and managed path to decarbonization. Democracy in Power is at once an essential history, a deeply relevant accounting of successes and failures, and a guide on how to avoid repeating past mistakes.",

We have no aesthetic mode whose very thought is the whole, a mode that can accommodate totality.”1 The 2008 economic crisis and global backdrop of struggles by 2011 renewed possibilities for thinking totality, materializing it for apprehension. The period demands its poetics.",

      "description": "I’ve been working on a physics-based marbling simulation to explore the ways that the traditional craft of paper marbling can be augmented digitally. Paper marbling is a centuries-old craft that uses the movement of water to create swirling patterns of inks and paints on paper (and sometimes fabric). The earliest accounts of marbling date back to the 12th century in Japan, where it is known as “suminagashi.” Inks were floated on top of water and manipulated into delicate, flowing shapes using breath, fans, and other utensils. Later, paper marbling traditions emerged in the Middle East and Europe, making use of more viscous media and fine-toothed combs to create repeating patterns with greater regularity and control.",

      "description": "WilliamS. Burroughs has been a major influence on literature in and out of the\nfield of the fantastique for decades. Burroughs burst on the scene with his\ninfamous hallucinogenic novel Naked Lunch, and continued with his experimental cut-up The Ticket That Exploded, and his more recent (and more accessible) novels Cities of the Red Night and The Western Lands. He hasbecome a cultural icon, but, more importantly, his work has influenced several generations of writers, some of whom have written fiction for Omni. So, thinking it only fitting that Omni publish his fiction, I commissioned a science fiction story by William Burroughs in 1986, asking only that it not be too sexual (considering his literary reputation). What I received was ''The Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar,\" an inspired literary and science fictional plea to save an\nendangered species in which Burroughs has taken a special interest The story\nwas first published in April 1987.

Akin to neo-Darwinist Richard Dawkins' concept of memes, hyperstitions work at the deeper evolutionary level of social organisation in that they influence the course taken by cultural evolution. Unlike memes, however, hyperstitions describe a specific category of ideas. Coined by renegade academics, the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU), hyperstition describes both the effects and the mechanisms of apocalyptic postmodern 'phase out' or 'meltdown' culture.",

While this overcomes the bottlenecks and biases of traditional gatekeepers, many believe it has unsustainably eroded the very social fabric it depends on by maximizing engagement for advertising revenue.",

But what can these approaches contribute in real-world contexts? We present a case study applying these techniques to find common ground between Israeli and Palestinian peacebuilders in the period following October 7th, 2023.",

Applications of these systems have been plagued by persistent inaccuracies in their output; these are often called “AI hallucinations”. We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs.",

History as a discipline dissolves the event back into the archive, turning history (event) into history (text), consigning it to the past. The legend is a way of making the summation of past events present to future ones.\"\n\nThis quotation from one of the comic book annotations in McKenzie Wark's Totality for Kids sums up the grand aspirations of the project, to make the ideas behind the Situationist International not only legible, but meaningful in a culture poised for submersion in the cynicism of neoliberal corporatism.

And to what extent is the city sort of - it seems to us that cities naturally do a lot of that work.. Cities tend to be chaotic. They tend to be, from a regulatory or enforcement perspective, tend to be a lot looser than especially suburbs, for example. And it seems like in that chaos - it turns into this weird, creative factory where sort of ad hoc, practical solutions in the form of informally circulated knowledge sets do a lot of work. Yeah, the phrase we're using is formalized without standardized. How do you scale those knowledge sets up in a way that could make them more sustainable or more powerful without sort of institutionalizing them or standardizing them in a way that has all the problems of bureaucracy and captured capital interests and stuff like that?",
