# Licensing Analysis: Commercial Viability of Cosmo

## Executive Summary

**UPDATED FINDING**: The Cosmo application now contains **ONLY ONE LGPL-3.0** licensed dependency that **MODERATELY RESTRICTS** commercial distribution options. The major Sharp/Next.js LGPL constraint has been **SUCCESSFULLY ELIMINATED**. Commercial sale is possible with compliance for the remaining single dependency.

**RECOMMENDATION**: Address the remaining RPC-WebSockets LGPL dependency or implement compliance measures for commercial distribution.

## License Distribution Analysis

### Overview of Dependencies (Production Only)

Based on comprehensive analysis of `package.json` and dependency tree:

- **Total Production Dependencies**: ~375+ packages (reduced after removing geist/next.js/sharp)
- **Primary License Types**: MIT (majority), Apache-2.0, BSD variants, ISC
- **PROBLEMATIC LICENSES**: 1 package with LGPL-3.0 constraints (MAJOR IMPROVEMENT ✅)

### License Categories

#### ✅ **COMMERCIAL-FRIENDLY LICENSES** (95%+ of dependencies)

- **MIT**: Most dependencies (~85%)
- **Apache-2.0**: ~8%
- **BSD-2-Clause/BSD-3-Clause**: ~3%
- **ISC**: ~2%
- **Unlicense**: ~1%
- **CC0-1.0**: Public domain equivalent
- **0BSD**: Public domain equivalent

#### ⚠️ **RESTRICTIVE LICENSES** (Remaining Issues)

- **LGPL-3.0-only**: 1 package (MODERATE IMPACT)
- **LGPL-3.0-or-later**: 0 packages (✅ RESOLVED)

---

## LGPL Dependencies Analysis

### ✅ 1. Sharp Image Processing Library Chain (RESOLVED)

**Former Dependency Path** (ELIMINATED):

```
❌ geist@1.4.2 (REMOVED)
└── ❌ next@15.3.3 (REMOVED)
    └── ❌ sharp@0.34.2 (REMOVED)
        └── ❌ @img/sharp-libvips-darwin-arm64@1.1.0 (LGPL-3.0-or-later) (REMOVED)
```

**Resolution**:

- **SOLUTION**: Switched to direct Geist font files (.woff2)
- **RESULT**: Eliminated entire Next.js/Sharp dependency chain
- **IMPACT**: Removed major LGPL licensing constraint
- **FONTS**: Still using Geist fonts via direct CSS @font-face declarations

### ⚠️ 2. RPC WebSocket Client (Remaining Issue)

**Dependency Path**:

```
arweave@1.15.1
└── rpc-websockets@9.1.1 (LGPL-3.0-only)
```

**Impact**:

- Used for Arweave blockchain WebSocket communication
- **LGPL-3.0-only** license (more restrictive than "or-later")
- Critical for Archive functionality
- **ONLY REMAINING** LGPL constraint in the application

## LGPL-3.0 Commercial Compliance Requirements

### Legal Obligations for Commercial Distribution

#### **MUST COMPLY WITH**:

1. **Source Code Disclosure**

   - Provide complete source code for LGPL-licensed libraries
   - Include all modifications made to LGPL libraries
   - Source code must be provided even if unmodified

2. **Dynamic Linking Requirements**

   - **RECOMMENDED**: Use dynamic linking with LGPL libraries
   - **AVOID**: Static linking (creates more complex obligations)
   - Must allow users to replace LGPL libraries with modified versions

3. **User Modification Rights**

   - Users must be able to modify and re-link LGPL libraries
   - Must provide "Installation Information" for consumer devices
   - **Anti-Tivoization**: Users must be able to run modified versions

4. **License Notification**

   - Prominent notice that LGPL libraries are used
   - Copy of LGPL license text must be provided
   - Cannot hide the fact that LGPL libraries are used

5. **Distribution Restrictions**
   - Cannot use distribution channels that conflict with LGPL terms
   - Some app stores may have incompatible terms
   - Patent clauses must be carefully reviewed

#### **CANNOT DO**:

- Sublicense LGPL code
- Restrict users' rights under LGPL
- Use in "closed devices" where users cannot install modifications
- Distribute through channels that prohibit source code sharing

---

## Commercial Distribution Risk Assessment

### **HIGH RISK SCENARIOS**

1. **App Store Distribution**

   - Apple App Store, Google Play Store terms may conflict with LGPL
   - Store policies often restrict source code sharing requirements
   - **RECOMMENDATION**: Legal review required for each store

2. **Embedded/IoT Devices**

   - LGPL-3.0 explicitly prohibits "tivoization"
   - Users must be able to install modified LGPL libraries
   - **IMPACT**: Impossible for locked-down devices

3. **Enterprise Licensing**

   - Many enterprises avoid LGPL due to compliance complexity
   - Source code sharing obligations may conflict with proprietary requirements
   - **IMPACT**: Reduced market opportunity

4. **SaaS/Cloud Distribution**
   - Network use doesn't trigger LGPL distribution requirements
   - **SAFE**: Web-based deployment generally compliant
   - **CAVEAT**: If distributing client applications, LGPL applies

### **MODERATE RISK SCENARIOS**

1. **Desktop Application Sales**

   - Feasible with proper LGPL compliance
   - Must provide source code and installation instructions
   - **REQUIREMENT**: Comprehensive compliance documentation

2. **Open Source Commercial Model**
   - Dual licensing approach possible
   - **STRATEGY**: Offer commercial license for LGPL-free version
   - **COMPLEXITY**: Requires alternative dependencies

## Specific Package Analysis

### ✅ Sharp (Image Processing) - RESOLVED

**Former License**: LGPL-3.0-or-later (libvips dependency) - **ELIMINATED**
**Former Function**: Image optimization in Next.js - **NO LONGER APPLICABLE**
**Commercial Impact**: **NONE** (dependency removed)

**Resolution**:

- ✅ Switched to direct Geist font files
- ✅ Eliminated Next.js/Sharp dependency chain
- ✅ No licensing constraints from this source

### ⚠️ RPC-WebSockets (Arweave Communication) - REMAINING ISSUE

**License**: LGPL-3.0-only
**Function**: WebSocket communication for Arweave blockchain
**Commercial Impact**: MODERATE (only remaining LGPL constraint)

**Compliance Requirements**:

- Provide complete source code for rpc-websockets
- Allow library replacement by users
- More restrictive than "or-later" version
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Only one library to manage (vs. previous multiple)

**Alternatives**:

- Use native WebSocket API with Arweave protocol
- Switch to MIT-licensed WebSocket libraries
- Implement custom Arweave RPC client
- Consider Arweave HTTP API instead of WebSocket where possible

## Conclusion

The Cosmo application's licensing situation has **SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED** with the elimination of the Sharp/Next.js LGPL constraint. The remaining single LGPL dependency **MODERATELY RESTRICTS** commercial distribution options. Commercial distribution is now much more feasible and requires either:

1. **LGPL compliance for one library** (much simpler than before)
2. **Single dependency replacement** (reduced development costs)

**UPDATED RECOMMENDATION**: Commercial distribution is now **VIABLE** with manageable compliance requirements. The single remaining LGPL dependency can be addressed through focused compliance or targeted replacement efforts.

**NEXT STEPS** (Updated Priority):

1. **OPTIONAL**: Legal consultation (reduced urgency due to single dependency)
2. Business strategy decision (simplified: compliance vs. replacement for one library)
3. Implementation planning (significantly reduced scope)
