# Custom Arweave Manifest for Clean URLs

## Planning Document for Quartz Internal Linking System Compatibility

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 11, 2025  
**Author:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to implement custom Arweave manifests that enable clean URLs (without .html extensions) for Meridian's Quartz-based site deployments. This is **critical** for Quartz's internal linking system to function properly on Arweave, as Quartz relies on clean URLs for its "wikilink" and internal navigation features.

## Problem Statement

### Current Issue:

- **arkb deployment creates basic manifests** that map files to their exact filenames (e.g., `gallery.html`)
- **Quartz internal links expect clean URLs** (e.g., `/gallery`, not `/gallery.html`)
- **Current URLs fail**: `https://arweave.net/manifest/gallery` → 404
- **Only .html URLs work**: `https://arweave.net/manifest/gallery.html` → ✅

### Why This Matters:

1. **Quartz Internal Linking**: Quartz generates wikilinks like `[[Gallery]]` that resolve to `/gallery`, not `/gallery.html`
2. **User Experience**: Clean URLs are more professional and user-friendly
3. **SEO Compatibility**: Search engines prefer clean URL structures
4. **Future-Proofing**: Maintains compatibility with modern static site standards

## Research Findings

### Arweave Path Manifest Structure

Based on web research, Arweave manifests use this structure:

```json
{
  "manifest": "arweave/paths",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "index": {
    "path": "index.html"
  },
  "fallback": {
    "id": "fallback-transaction-id"
  },
  "paths": {
    "index.html": {
      "id": "transaction-id-of-index-html"
    },
    "gallery": {
      "id": "transaction-id-of-gallery-html"
    },
    "gallery.html": {
      "id": "transaction-id-of-gallery-html"
    },
    "about": {
      "id": "transaction-id-of-about-html"
    },
    "about.html": {
      "id": "transaction-id-of-about-html"
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Requirements:

1. **Dual Mapping**: Both clean URLs (`/gallery`) and .html URLs (`/gallery.html`) should map to the same transaction
2. **Fallback Support**: Handle undefined routes gracefully
3. **Content-Type**: Must be uploaded with `application/x.arweave-manifest+json`
4. **Transaction ID Extraction**: Need to extract individual file transaction IDs from arkb bundle

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Post-Deployment Manifest Enhancement

**Approach**: After arkb completes the bundle deployment, create and upload a custom manifest with clean URL mappings.

#### Step 1: Extract File Transaction IDs from Bundle ✅ SOLVED

- **Original Challenge**: arkb bundles files together, making individual transaction IDs unavailable
- **RESEARCH BREAKTHROUGH**: ✅ **arkb already provides individual file transaction IDs in its output!**
- **Solution**: Simple regex parsing of arkb stdout to extract file information
- **Complexity**: **LOW** - straightforward text parsing, no external tools needed

#### Step 2: Generate Enhanced Manifest

```typescript
async function createEnhancedManifest(
  bundleFiles: ArweaveFile[],
  originalManifestId: string
): Promise<ArweaveManifest> {
  const manifest = {
    manifest: "arweave/paths",
    version: "0.2.0",
    index: { path: "index.html" },
    fallback: { id: findFileId("index.html", bundleFiles) },
    paths: {},
  };

  // Add both clean and .html URLs for each page
  bundleFiles.forEach((file) => {
    if (file.path.endsWith(".html")) {
      const cleanPath = file.path.replace(".html", "");
      manifest.paths[file.path] = { id: file.transactionId };
      manifest.paths[cleanPath] = { id: file.transactionId };
    } else {
      manifest.paths[file.path] = { id: file.transactionId };
    }
  });

  return manifest;
}
```

#### Step 3: Upload Enhanced Manifest

- Use ArDrive CLI or arkb to upload the custom manifest
- Set proper content type: `application/x.arweave-manifest+json`
- Return the new manifest transaction ID as the primary site URL

### Phase 2: Integration with Meridian Deployment Process

#### Modify `uploadDirectoryWithArkb()` Method:

```typescript
public async uploadDirectoryWithArkb(
  buildPath: string,
  manifest: ArweaveDeployManifest
): Promise<ArweaveDeployResult> {
  // 1. Execute normal arkb deployment
  const arkbResult = await this.executeArkbDeployment(buildPath, manifest);

  // 2. Extract file information from arkb output
  const bundleFiles = this.parseArkbFileList(arkbResult.stdout);

  // 3. Create enhanced manifest with clean URLs
  const enhancedManifest = await this.createEnhancedManifest(bundleFiles);

  // 4. Upload enhanced manifest
  const manifestResult = await this.uploadEnhancedManifest(enhancedManifest);

  // 5. Return enhanced manifest as primary URL
  return {
    ...arkbResult,
    manifestHash: manifestResult.transactionId,
    manifestUrl: `https://arweave.net/${manifestResult.transactionId}`,
    url: `https://arweave.net/${manifestResult.transactionId}`,
    enhancedManifest: true
  };
}
```

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Bundle File Extraction Analysis ✅ COMPLETED

**MAJOR DISCOVERY:** arkb output already provides individual file transaction IDs!

**Research Results:**

- ✅ **arkb outputs file-level transaction IDs** in its deploy output
- ✅ **Files are individually addressable** within bundles (ANS-104 standard)
- ✅ **arbundles library available** for parsing bundle contents programmatically
- ✅ **arkb output parsing is feasible** - file information is clearly structured

**Sample arkb Output Analysis:**

```bash
[arkb] ID                                           Size           Type                          Path
[arkb] 2oGKMiXFWwDM7tB_byz3epebE0hjB3k1nysMCtm6SxU  14.96 kB       text/html                     404.html
[arkb] LdRRZDPkx7NUR9aFbQE53dda9CQKRus5PZ_JV-JH76o  35.02 kB       text/html                     about.html
[arkb] 2Qx6aiZKyMfCMh9dN9uWJM2KCzTZX3X2EOBntKkKE9I  31.85 kB       text/html                     gallery.html
```

**Key Findings:**

- Individual file transaction IDs: ✅ **AVAILABLE in arkb output**
- File paths: ✅ **Clearly listed**
- Content types: ✅ **Provided**
- Parsing complexity: ✅ **LOW - simple regex parsing**

**Proof-of-Concept Implementation:**

```typescript
function parseArkbOutput(arkbOutput: string): ArweaveFile[] {
  const lines = arkbOutput.split('\n');
  const files: ArweaveFile[] = [];
  let inFileSection = false;

  for (const line of lines) {
    // Look for the file listing section
    if (line.includes('ID') && line.includes('Size') && line.includes('Type') && line.includes('Path')) {
      inFileSection = true;
      continue;
    }

    // Stop when we hit the summary section
    if (line.includes('Summary') || line.includes('Total size:')) {
      inFileSection = false;
      continue;
    }

    // Parse file lines
    if (inFileSection && line.trim()) {
      const match = line.match(/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]{43})\s+[\d.]+\s+[kKmMgG]?B?\s+[-\d.]*\s+([^\s]+)\s+(.+)/);
      if (match) {
        const [, id, type, path] = match;
        files.push({
          id: id.trim(),
          type: type.trim(),
          path: path.trim()
        });
      }
    }
  }

  return files;
}

// Generated enhanced manifest example:
{
  "manifest": "arweave/paths",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "index": { "path": "index.html" },
  "paths": {
    "404.html": { "id": "2oGKMiXFWwDM7tB_byz3epebE0hjB3k1nysMCtm6SxU" },
    "about.html": { "id": "LdRRZDPkx7NUR9aFbQE53dda9CQKRus5PZ_JV-JH76o" },
    "about": { "id": "LdRRZDPkx7NUR9aFbQE53dda9CQKRus5PZ_JV-JH76o" },
    "gallery.html": { "id": "2Qx6aiZKyMfCMh9dN9uWJM2KCzTZX3X2EOBntKkKE9I" },
    "gallery": { "id": "2Qx6aiZKyMfCMh9dN9uWJM2KCzTZX3X2EOBntKkKE9I" }
  }
}
```

### Low Risk:

- **Quartz Compatibility**: Quartz should work seamlessly with clean URLs
- **User Experience**: Enhanced URLs provide clear UX benefits
- **Future Compatibility**: Clean URLs align with web standards

## Success Criteria

### Must Have:

- ✅ **Clean URLs work**: `/gallery` serves `gallery.html` content
- ✅ **Quartz links function**: Internal wikilinks resolve correctly
- ✅ **Fallback handling**: Undefined routes redirect appropriately
- ✅ **Backward compatibility**: `.html` URLs continue to work

### Should Have:

- ✅ **Performance**: Enhanced manifest adds <30 seconds to deployment
- ✅ **Cost efficiency**: Additional costs <10% of base deployment
- ✅ **Error handling**: Graceful fallback to basic manifest on errors
- ✅ **Documentation**: Clear user guide for URL structure

### Nice to Have:

- ✅ **Auto-detection**: System automatically determines best manifest approach
- ✅ **Configuration options**: User control over clean URL generation
- ✅ **Analytics integration**: Track clean URL usage and performance
- ✅ **SEO optimization**: Enhanced metadata for clean URLs
