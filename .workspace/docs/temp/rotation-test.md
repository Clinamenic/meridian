# Rotation Test Results

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Contour Jiggling**:

   - Removed duplicate `generateContourLines(vWorldPosition)` call
   - Modified `generateContourLines` to accept `noisePos` instead of `worldPos`
   - Ensured contour lines use the same noise position as elevation calculation

2. **Enhanced Rotation**:

   - Increased `autoRotateSpeed` from 0.3 to 1.0 for more visible rotation
   - Added debug logging to verify rotation is happening
   - Confirmed rotation matrix is applied in vertex shader

3. **Preset System**:
   - Consolidated all parameters into `OrganicWaveRenderer.js`
   - Created `landing` preset with elevation animation disabled
   - Simplified `landing.js` to use preset system

## Expected Behavior

- **Smooth rotation**: Sphere should rotate around Y-axis without jiggling
- **Static contours**: Topographic lines should remain stable during rotation
- **No texture animation**: Terrain texture should not move independently of sphere

## Debug Output

The console should show rotation values like:

```
Rotation Y: 0.00
Rotation Y: 0.10
Rotation Y: 0.20
...
```

## Test Steps

1. Load landing page
2. Check console for rotation debug output
3. Observe sphere rotation (should be clearly visible)
4. Verify contours don't jiggle during rotation
5. Confirm texture stays fixed to sphere surface

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Console shows rotation debug output
- [ ] Sphere rotates smoothly around Y-axis
- [ ] Contour lines remain stable (no jiggling)
- [ ] Terrain texture rotates with sphere
- [ ] No performance degradation
