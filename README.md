# Meridian: Local-First Multi-Tool Interface

Meridian is a local-first Electron desktop application that bridges individual knowledge management with global social coordination. The app features three core tools: **Collate** (URL resource management), **Archive** (Arweave upload), and **Broadcast** (social media scheduling).

## Features

### ðŸ”— Collate - URL Resource Manager

- Add and organize web resources with metadata extraction
- Tag-based organization with search and filtering
- Automatic title, description, and image extraction
- Local JSON storage with workspace integration
- Duplicate URL detection and management

### ðŸ“¦ Archive - Arweave Upload Tool

- Upload files to Arweave permanent storage via arkb
- Cost estimation and wallet balance checking
- Transaction tracking and status monitoring
- Custom tagging for uploaded content
- Bundle upload support for multiple files

### ðŸ“¢ Broadcast - Social Media Scheduler

- Multi-platform posting to Bluesky, Farcaster, and Twitter
- Draft management and post scheduling
- Platform-specific character limits and previews
- Secure credential management with OS-level encryption
- Linear calendar interface for content planning

## Technical Architecture

### Built With

- **Electron** (latest LTS) with security-hardened configuration
- **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability
- **Plain CSS** with modern features (Grid, Flexbox, Custom Properties)
- **Local-first** data storage with JSON documents

### Security & Performance

- **safeStorage API** for encrypted credential storage
- **Secure IPC** between main and renderer processes
- **Content Security Policy** for XSS prevention
- **Virtual scrolling** for large collections (10k+ items)
- **Background data validation** and atomic file writes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- arkb CLI (for Arweave functionality)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd meridian

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the application
npm start
```

### Development

```bash
# Start in development mode with hot reload
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Package for distribution
npm run package
```

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Launch Meridian
2. Select a workspace directory (creates `/data` and `/attachments` subdirectories)
3. Use the three-tab interface to access different tools

### Data Storage

```
<workspace>/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ collate.json       # Resource collection
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ archive.json       # Arweave uploads
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ broadcast.json     # Social posts
â””â”€â”€ attachments/           # Local file cache
```

### Collate Tool

- Click "Add Resource" to add a new URL
- Use "Extract Metadata" to automatically fill title and description
- Add comma-separated tags for organization
- Use the search bar to filter resources
- Click on tag filters to narrow results

### Archive Tool

- Click "Upload File" to select and upload files to Arweave
- Check wallet balance before uploading
- Monitor upload status and transaction confirmations
- Add custom tags to organize uploads

### Broadcast Tool

- Click "New Post" to create content
- Select target platforms (Bluesky, Farcaster, Twitter)
- Save as draft or schedule for later posting
- Manage platform credentials in settings

## Configuration

### Platform Authentication

#### Bluesky

- Sign in with your Bluesky handle/email and password
- Credentials are encrypted and stored securely

#### Farcaster

- Generate app-specific keys (implementation pending)
- Store FID and authentication tokens

#### Twitter

- Set up Twitter API v2 credentials (implementation pending)
- OAuth 2.0 authentication flow

#### Arweave

- Install and configure arkb CLI with wallet
- Ensure sufficient AR balance for uploads

### Workspace Integration

- Choose any directory as your workspace
- Data is stored in JSON format for portability
- Export to Markdown, CSV, or other formats
- Compatible with Obsidian vaults and note-taking apps
